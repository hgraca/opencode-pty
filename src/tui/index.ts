// =============================================================================
// src/tui/index.ts
// PTY sidebar TUI plugin: lists the plugin's sessions in the sidebar and shows
// a session's live output in a dialog.
//
// Design notes, each learned the hard way:
//
//  - **Default-export an object `{ id, tui }`.** Named exports fail to load with
//    "Plugin export is not a function".
//  - **Build elements lazily, inside a render pass.** `createElement` resolves
//    its renderer from a Solid context, so constructing one outside a render
//    throws "No renderer found". Never precompute elements.
//  - **`sidebar_content` is additive** (with an `order`), so this panel sits
//    alongside the built-ins rather than replacing them.
//  - **Present output in a dialog**, not a route and not a mirror session: a
//    route replaces the entire view, and child-session views have no sidebar.
//  - **Take the LATEST posted URL.** The PTY server binds a random port on every
//    start, so an older message holds a dead origin.
//  - **`/buffer/plain` returns JSON** (`{ plain, byteLength }`), CRLF-terminated.
//  - **Stop propagation at a control nested in a row or the header.** opentui
//    bubbles a mouse event to the parent only while `propagationStopped` is
//    false, so the row's `✕` and the header's clear action must swallow the
//    event or they also open the dialog / collapse the panel.
//  - **Fail loudly.** A silent no-op is indistinguishable from a bug, so every
//    failure path surfaces a status line and a toast.
//
// The PTY server is a hard dependency: its HTTP API is the only window onto PTY
// sessions. It publishes its bound address for discovery, and is started on
// demand through the plugin's own `pty-show-server-url` command.
