// Runtime discovery: the PTY server publishes its origin to a small file, so the
// sidebar can find it without /proc (Linux-only) and without scraping the chat.
//
// A file is used rather than an advisory lock because Bun exposes no flock API
// and Windows has no equivalent — but no lock is needed: `/health` is the
// liveness test, so the file only has to carry the address. Nothing here treats a
// record as authority; a reader validates every candidate by probing it.
//
// Two deliberate consequences of that:
//   - a reader NEVER deletes a record. PID liveness is namespace-sensitive (a
//     container's pid is not visible from the host) and a partial read looks like
//     corruption, so a reader cannot prove a record is stale. The owner removes
//     its own record on dispose; anything left over is simply ignored.
//   - writes are atomic (temp + rename), so a reader never sees a half-written
//     record.
