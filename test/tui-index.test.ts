// Regression tests for the plugin factory's STARTUP contract.
//
// Three things must hold, all learned the hard way from the startup trace:
//
//  1. The factory must not await its first refresh. opencode's TUI plugin loader
//     awaits every plugin factory before the TUI becomes usable, showing its
//     "Loading plugins…" overlay the whole time.
//  2. Loading must not start the PTY server. Starting it goes through the
//     plugin's command handler in a throwaway session — server initialisation
//     plus a session create/delete does not belong on the startup path.
//  3. A start must still be reachable when the user asks: expanding the sidebar
//     panel is the only trigger.
//
// The TUI half cannot be driven headlessly, so the two display-only imports are
// mocked and the api is stubbed; the assertions are about timing and side
// effects, not rendering.
